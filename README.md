With over a decade of experience in IT and 17 technical certifications, I am a Cloud Architect, graduated in Computer Science from UNIP Bauru. Commitment to effective communication, adaptability, and constant search for innovation. In the last 3 years, I started my studies in cloud technologies, and 1 year ago I directed my focus to DevOps, discovering new opportunities and challenges that boosted my professional growth.

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in DevOps, using and studying the latest tools in the market. AWS and OCI as cloud platforms. Azure DevOps, GitLab, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions for automation of CI/CD pipelines, all using YAML files. I have also worked with Terraform and Ansible to implement infrastructure as code, and Docker and Kubernetes for microservices orchestration. Using GitOps: Git for version control, GitHub, GitLab, and ArgoCD. I have experience in Windows and Linux operating systems and script automation with PowerShell and am currently expanding my knowledge in Python.

I have skills in monitoring and observability using Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix, and Datadog. I am committed to delivering effective and modern solutions, always in line with industry best practices. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and provide the best possible customer experience.
